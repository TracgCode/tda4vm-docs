Debugging SPL in OpenOCD
========================

The following guide demonstrates how to connect a board to OpenOCD and
load the SPL symbols for debugging with a K3 generation device. For the
guide below, users are expected to generate custom binaries, boot their
board from an SD card and work with OpenOCD in a Linux environment. This
guide uses the AM625-SK for device specific examples but can be extended
to any K3 generation device. Use the U-Boot documentation below to begin
using OpenOCD with a K3 generation device.
